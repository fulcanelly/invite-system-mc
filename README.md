# Invite guard

## motivation

Often when you play minecraft server some ill-wishes persons can appear and spoil entire gameplay.
In such case you can try to sweep server under the carpet -- set up firewall, use whitelist etc. 
But all this approaches have significant disadvantages.
For example talking about whitelist we instantly stumbleupon few problems:
 - it's nearly non-scalable, if you want to connect it to some service it would be very challenging
 - for newcomers it's hard to get in touch with players to ask them .
 - hard toi localize
 
So invite guard intended to solve this prolems.
